            John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/;[a] 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English
            writer, poet, philologist, and academic, best known as the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and
            The Lord of the Rings.

            He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford from
            1925 to 1945 and the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College,
            Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary
            discussion group The Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen
            Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.

            After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes
            and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the
            Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays
            about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth.[b] Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied
            the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.
        </p>
        <p>
            While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and
            The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be
            popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.
