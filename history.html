            The History of Middle-earth is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 that collect and
            analyse much of Tolkien's legendarium, compiled and edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The series shows
            the development over time of Tolkien's conception of Middle-earth as a fictional place with its own peoples,
            languages, and history, from his earliest notions of a "mythology for England" through to the development of
            the stories that make up The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. It is not a "history of Middle-earth"
            in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is
            instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000â€“01, the twelve volumes were
            republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were
            published in 2002.[1]
